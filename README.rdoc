= UuidStamper

Tested with rails 4.2.1 should work with rails 5

If you are working with pagination on a pages
And you want to sort them on e.g. Rating and many records holds the same value for rating
Then you can't rely on what the database throw back at you when you ask for a batch on pages

Without uuis_stamper this will not be relyable
@cakes = Cake.order(:rating).page(params[:page]).per(32))

Notice you can also use it with numbers if you store them in the db as strings

Usage

Add to gemfile
gem 'uuid_stamper', git: 'git://github.com/maxgronlund/uuid_stamper.git'


Uniqifying a string/number
UNIQIFYED_STRING = SOME_NOT_UNIQ_STRING.to_uniq

Turn the same string back to whas it was before for viewing on the screen
SOME_NOT_UNIQ_STRING = UNIQIFYED_STRING.from_uniq

Don't use from_uniq on Fixum and Float use plain old Ruby .to_i or to_f

Example solving the problem
cake.rating = params[:rating].to_uniq
Then the pagination will work
@cakes = Cake.order(:rating).page(params[:page]).per(32))
